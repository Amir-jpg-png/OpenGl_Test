# OpenGL Test

### Repo description

This Repo is just a repo for me to test a bit and play around with OpenGL,
as well as for me to abstract away a bit of OpenGl functionality once I start
taking a look at developing a game engine.

### Project Structure

**Language**: C++, GLSL
**Build System**: CMake
**External Libraries**:

- OpenGl (For graphics rendering)
- stb_image (For converting resources like images into a texture format)
- GLEW (For recognizing which OpenGl functions the GPU allows)
- GLFW (For creating windows on all operating systems, without explicitly accessing the OS API)

### Set up

As this is just a demo with no real use you can play around with it, so you yourself can learn a bit about OpenGl.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amir-jpg-png/OpenGl_Test.git
```

Afterwards you can build and run the project like this

```bash
./build
```
